  <p>My business was established in 2004 in the vibrant seaside town of Scarborough.</p>

  <p>I have been in the trade for around {{ $yearsInTrade }} years, starting off as a valeter for Arundale Peugeot, Scarborough. I then assisted the running of a local valeting business, before seeing the opportunity to work for myself as a mobile valeter. The business has gone from strength to strength and continues its success to this day.</p>

  <p>It's now {{ $year }} and I've been running my own business for around {{ $yearsRunning }} years, operating within the area to provide a high quality, professional valeting service for thousands of customers throughout the region.</p>
